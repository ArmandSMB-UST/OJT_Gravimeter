# OJT_Gravimeter

A simulation software created in compliance to UST-Science, SCI404 course requirements of on-the-job training (OJT) under the supervision of Leo T. Armada, PhD.

About:
	The program is a simulation of a one-dimensional (1D) spring-based gravimeter that was designed to be interactive. This could be used for virtual experiments and visualization for lectures. It features 3 experiments that was designed to help students have a better grasp on the concepts on the working mechanism of a gravimeter. It also provides insights on possible applications for real-life situations.

This was a collaborative effort of UST, UP, NU and UE students.
