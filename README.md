# OJT_Gravimeter  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a simulation software created in compliance to PRACTICUM (SCI404) course requirements for the A.Y. 2021-2022. This is part of on-the-job training (OJT) of Armando Salvador M. Bambao, a 3rd year BS Applied Physics student of UST. This project was manifested under the supervision of Leo T. Armada, PhD.  

### About:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The program is a simulation of a one-dimensional (1D) spring-based gravimeter that was designed to be interactive. This could be used for virtual experiments and visualization for lectures. It features 3 experiments that was designed to help students have a better grasp on the concepts on the working mechanism of a gravimeter. It also provides insights on possible applications for real-life situations. Keep it mind however, that the program has limitations such as taking only the vertical component of the forces acting on the spring which is not true in real-world settings.

This was a collaborative effort of UST, UP, NU and UE students.
